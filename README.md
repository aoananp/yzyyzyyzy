brute-force open source adc script

## Aim
- run multiple headless browsers in attempt to increase odds of passing adidas splash screen
- allow server support (host and node setup)
- provide an easy to use GUI which allows the user to control all aspects of the nodes from the host computer
- automatically feed cookies of passed splash instances back to the host computer
- integrate a stock checker into the GUI
- integrate a page monitor to check for when the queue goes live
- be as lightweight as possible

Not guaranteed to work. Not my fault if it doesn't. They're only shoes.
